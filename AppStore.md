# Notate — App Store Connect submission package

Everything below is paste-ready. Account-side steps are the only thing blocking submission; all copy, the privacy URL, and the build are done.

## Status (2026-05-30)
- iOS Release: **BUILD SUCCEEDED** (signing aside, verified this session).
- Device family set to iPhone-only (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1"`) — iPhone screenshots only, no iPad QA.
- Privacy policy live target: **https://notate.heyitsmejosh.com/privacy.html** (served from this repo's `docs/privacy.html` via GitHub Pages — verified 200).
- Privacy manifest bundled, `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` set, StoreKit 2 local entitlement done.

## The one blocker (only Joshua can do these)
1. Enroll Apple Developer Program — $99 USD/yr. This gates every step below and every App Store dollar across all 38 apps. Highest-ROI $99 on the board.
2. Create app record: bundle `com.nulljosh.echo` (iOS), team QMM486NPYC.
3. Create IAP: non-consumable `com.nulljosh.echo.unlock`, $7.99 (Tier 8), reference name "Notate Pro". Attach one paywall screenshot (IAP is reviewed with the first version).
4. App Privacy: select **Data Not Collected** (paste the privacy URL above).
5. Run the macOS sandbox smoke test before submitting the Mac build (mic permission, WhisperKit model lands in sandbox container, file import works). Ship iOS first if the Mac sandbox test slips — do not let it block the iPhone submission.

## App Review notes (paste into Review Information)
```
Notate transcribes speech entirely on-device using a Whisper model (WhisperKit). No account or login is required and no data leaves the device, so there are no demo credentials needed.

To test the in-app purchase:
1. Live microphone transcription is free and unlimited. Tap record and speak.
2. File transcription is free for the first 3 files, then prompts Notate Pro ($7.99, one-time non-consumable, com.nulljosh.echo.unlock).
3. "Restore Purchase" is in the paywall and in Settings.

The first model download requires network once; after that the app is fully offline. Microphone permission is requested only when the user taps record.
```

## Screenshots needed (iPhone 6.7" / 6.9", use the `screenshot` skill)
1. Live transcription with the waveform animating
2. A finished transcript with the share/copy bar
3. History list
4. The Notate Pro paywall (doubles as the IAP review screenshot)
5. Settings showing model + language pickers
