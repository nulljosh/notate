Notate transcribes speech, music, and audio files entirely on your iPhone. No account, no cloud, no subscription. Your audio never leaves the device.

Powered by an on-device Whisper model, Notate transcribes live from the microphone or from audio files you import. Whether it's your voice, song lyrics, podcasts, or lectures, everything runs locally, so it works on a plane, in a basement, anywhere, and nothing you say is ever uploaded.

ONE PAYMENT, EVERYTHING INCLUDED
- Unlimited live microphone transcription
- Unlimited audio file transcription
- Every language Whisper knows with auto-detect
- All models (Auto, Tiny, Base, Small, Turbo)
- Full history, copy, and share
- Speak back with system voice

WHY NOTATE
- On device. Your voice stays yours.
- No account, no sign-up, no tracking.
- No subscription, no recurring charge.

Notate is built for people who want their words, music, and audio transcribed without uploading to a server.

## App Review notes (paste into Review Information)
```
Notate transcribes speech entirely on-device using a Whisper model (WhisperKit). No account or login is required and no data leaves the device, so there are no demo credentials needed.

All features are included with the app purchase. No in-app purchases, no paywalls, no paywall screenshots. Everything is unlocked.

Test transcription:
1. Live microphone transcription: tap record and speak, text appears as you talk.
2. File import: drag or select an audio file, it transcribes the whole thing.
3. Any of the 99+ languages Whisper supports, with auto-detect.
4. Settings > Advanced lets you manually pick a model, but Auto is recommended.

The first model download requires network once; after that the app is fully offline. Microphone permission is requested only when the user taps record.
```

## Screenshots needed (iPhone 6.7" / 6.9", use the `screenshot` skill)
1. Live transcription with the waveform animating
2. A finished transcript with the share/copy bar
3. History list
4. Settings showing model + language pickers
5. Optional: file import in progress
