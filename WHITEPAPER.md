# Voxprint Technical Whitepaper

**v1.3.7** | August 2026

Speech to text that never leaves your device.

Cloud transcription means every recording passes through someone else's
server before it becomes text, which is a bad trade for anything personal.
Voxprint transcribes on iPhone and Mac. No cloud, no network call. The audio stays
where you recorded it because on-device Whisper models are now good enough that
the privacy cost of a server round-trip buys nothing in return.

## Transcription Pipeline

`TranscriptionEngine` (Services/) is the core. It loads a WhisperKit model
sized to the device's RAM, then batches live audio in 2-second windows and
runs greedy decoding on each batch as it fills, so text appears within
seconds of speaking rather than after the recording ends, because a
transcript that only shows up when you stop talking defeats the point of
live dictation.

- **Live buffer**: capped at 30s (Whisper's practical max window). Only the
  trailing ~8s is re-decoded per 2s tick, not the full rolling buffer, so
  decode time stays flat as a recording grows instead of increasing on every
  tick, which is what a growing recording would otherwise do.
- **Model persistence**: WhisperKit's default cache directory
  (HuggingFace Caches) is purgeable by iOS under storage pressure. After the
  first successful download, Voxprint copies the model into Application Support,
  which iOS does not purge, so subsequent launches load instantly instead of
  re-downloading a model that can run to hundreds of megabytes.
- **Model selection**: chosen automatically at launch based on available
  device memory, no user-facing model picker, because the right model is a
  device fact, not a preference worth asking a user to reason about.

## Structure

```
Sources/
  iOS/        VoxprintApp.swift, Info.plist, Assets.xcassets
  macOS/      VoxprintApp.swift, Info.plist, entitlements, Assets.xcassets
  Models/     TranscriptionEntry (Codable: id, text, date, duration, model)
  Services/   TranscriptionEngine, AudioCapture
  Views/      ContentView, RecordButton, TranscriptionView, WaveformBarsView,
              HistoryView, SettingsView, SplashView
```

## Platforms

| Platform | Framework | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| iOS | SwiftUI | iOS 17+, WhisperKit via SPM |
| macOS | SwiftUI | macOS 14+, sandboxed (Mac App Store IAP requirement) |

Versioning lives only in `project.yml` (`MARKETING_VERSION` /
`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`), Info.plists reference it via build variable, never
hardcoded.

## Security / Privacy

All transcription runs on-device via WhisperKit; no audio or text is
transmitted anywhere. `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` bundled in both targets.
`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`. macOS target runs under the App
Sandbox.
